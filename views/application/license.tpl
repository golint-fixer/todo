<h1>About this</h1>

<p>
This is an application that allows you to store "to do" lists as
<em>topics</em>. Topics are written in the markdown format.
The source code and the documentation of this application can be found
<a href="https://github.com/mssola/todo" title="Source code of this application">here</a>.
Moreover, you might also be interested in the CLI client that I usually
use to handle the contents of this application. It's also free software and it
can be found <a href="https://github.com/mssola/td" title="Source code of the td CLI tool">here</a>.
